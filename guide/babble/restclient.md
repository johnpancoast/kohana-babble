# Using a REST Client

Since we'll be dealing with API requests to a REST server that you're
creating, you'll likely want to use an easy to use REST client. I'd recommend
the [Restify](https://github.com/morgan/kohana-restify) Kohana module. Here's
an [example of how it looks](http://restify.io/).

I've used this module a lot while developing Babble since it allows me to
easily change URIs, headers, request method and the request body.
