# Logging
You can enable logging by setting the `debug` config value to TRUE. The log will
show you any exception messages that were caught, request and response data,
and the media type classes and version modules that were loaded.

[!!] In production, this will add A LOT of data to your logs. Probably a bad idea!!!
