# Babble

Babble is a framework for creating a RESTful API in Kohana. It includes
support for authentication, content negotiation, XML and JSON support
including ability to create additional media types, versions loaded as kohana
modules which leverages the power of Kohana's cascading file system, easy
creation of response resources that can include [HATEOAS
links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) & embedded resources, and the
abililty to easily add CRUD support on top of ORM models. You can also add
support for other ORMs fairly easily.
