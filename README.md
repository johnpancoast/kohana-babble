aiming to adhere to all of the tenets of the REST architecture This is also a
learning expirement for me. =)

## Version 0.1.0
This is release 0.1.0 of kohana-babble. It is still in its infancy. This
version includes model abstraction, media types & content negotiation, and
controller versioning (structure to be changed) but these things are all still
early on in their development. Babble is not in a ready state.
